About the RViz config file clicked_point.rviz:

HOW TO RUN
-------------
[connect a Kinect to your computer]
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
[open RViz]
[File -> Open Config -> clicked_point.rviz]

WHAT IT DOES
-------------
The RViz "Publish Point" button publishes a 3D position on the topic "/clicked_point" whenever the user clicks on a so-called "object" in the RViz viewer window. This RViz configuration allows the user to see the *image* from the Kinect using the Camera plugin, but for clicks on that *image* to return 3D points in the *point cloud*. The "Publish Point" icon is only visible for the user when the mouse is hovering over a valid point in the pointcloud...or a TF frame, or a gridline, or any other "object" in RViz. 

WHAT IT'S FOR
------------
Use this if you want to click on a point on a 2D image, and get back a 3D position from the depth sensor. I intend to use it to place virtual privacy markers.
