To get color info into OctoMaps:
+ try rgbdslam

First implementation of OctoMap:
+ make one from a stored point cloud (.pcd file)
+ visualize with [octovis]
+ make a color one
+ visualize in color
+ project onto image plane
+ display image

https://code.google.com/p/alufr-ros-pkg/source/browse/trunk/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/src/ColorOctomapServer.cpp

Next steps (ideas):
+ Implement camera movement
- Separate octomap for each privacy category
  - API for dividing one map into several
- API for grabbing different resolutions...even in different regions
+ What's better? Lower-res map or lower-res image? ANSWER: Probably image
- API for multi-res image (lower/higher res by region)
-> How to do redaction?
  - Big Bounding Box that intercepts rays
  - Delete or flag individual leaves
- Test speed with downsampling cloud data before updating octree
- See how RGBDslam does color updating
- Look into using RGBD_SLAM on PR2 head for localization+registration
- Integrate with octomap_server
- Fixed viewpoints with continuous rotation (a la Google Street View or Myst)
- Debug the thing where ray casting fails as viewpoint changes

Next demo:
PR2 looking at a whiteboard. One or two markers (e.g. AR tags,
post-its) are used to indicate the private area, which we redact using
the octree. Perhaps full res everywhere when not filtering, low res
everywhere when we are.
