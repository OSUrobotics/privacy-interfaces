FUNCTIONAL OUTLINE:

	   0. Given video of a person wearing the green hat and moving around, sometimes facing the camera
	      a. Note: bag first, but don't re-publish the messages; use rosbag to take them singly so as not to miss any

	   1. Filters the person's face
	      a. Measures UV face location and size using face detector
	      b. Tracks "   " using Kalman Filter
	      c. (Given user-specified confidence level)
	      d. Filters image by including all face locations and sizes within confidence level

	   2. Evaluates filter performance
	      a. Finds green hat *UV and XYZ* location and size
	      b. Finds face pixels
	      	 i. Remove green hat (GrabCut?)
		 ii. Use XYZ information and foreknowledge of the person's head dimensions to chop at the neck
		 iii. Use blob-finding on depth image to cut out the face (er, head)
	      c. Compute metrics

	   3. Concatenate, Analyze, and Plot Data 
	      a. (MATLAB?)
